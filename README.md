# KuView: A browser-based, real-time Kubernetes dashboard

[![KuView Demo](./sample.png)](https://youtu.be/4mpiOiLgfLE)

KuView is a real-time, read-only Kubernetes dashboard that runs entirely in your web browser. It provides an immediate and comprehensive overview of your cluster's status and resource utilization, with no server-side installation or `kubectl` plugins required for its primary mode of operation.

## Quick Start Guide

There are two ways to run KuView:

### 1. Run KuView locally with `kubectl proxy`

This method is ideal for quick, personal use without altering your cluster. Ensure `kubectl` is configured to access your cluster.

```bash
# Download and extract the latest release
curl -sL https://r2.iwanhae.kr/kuview/latest.tar.gz | tar xvz

# Initiate the dashboard
kubectl proxy -w ./dist
```

Navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:8001/static** in your web browser.

**That's it!**

### 2. Deploy on your cluster

This method provides better performance and is suitable for team usage.

```bash
# Create a namespace for KuView
kubectl create namespace kuview

# Create a ClusterRole for read-only access
kubectl create clusterrole kuview \
	--verb=get,list,watch \
	--resource=nodes,pods,pods/log,namespaces,services,\
	endpointslices.discovery.k8s.io,\
	nodes.metrics.k8s.io,pods.metrics.k8s.io

# Create a ServiceAccount for KuView
kubectl create -n kuview serviceaccount kuview

# Bind the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount
kubectl create -n kuview clusterrolebinding kuview \
	--clusterrole=kuview \
	--serviceaccount=kuview:kuview

# Deploy KuView
kubectl create -n kuview deployment kuview --image ghcr.io/iwanhae/kuview:latest --port 8001
kubectl patch -n kuview deployments.apps kuview --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName":"kuview"}}}}'

# Expose the service as a NodePort (optional, you can use ingress or port-forwarding instead)
kubectl expose -n kuview deployment kuview --port 8001 --type=NodePort

# Now you can access KuView at http://<node-ip>:<node-port>/
```

## Core Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Observe live updates of resource states and events within your cluster.
- **Comprehensive Resource Visualization**: Visualize relationships between resources to gain a deeper understanding of your cluster's architecture.
- **Client-Side Operation**: Run anywhere with `kubectl` access. No cluster-side installation is required for the proxy-based approach.
- **Secure Read-only Access**: Ensures cluster safety with strictly read-only access, preventing any modifications to your cluster state.
- **Responsive User Interface**: Fully responsive UI for a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Features a clean and intuitive interface built with React for an optimal user experience.

## For Development

Instructions for setting up a development environment.

### Wasm Development

For developing the WebAssembly-based client:

1.  Run `kubectl proxy` to connect to the Kubernetes API server.
2.  Run `npm run wasm` to build the Wasm binary.
3.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server for the web client.

### Server-Side Development

For developing the Go-based server component:

1.  Run `go run ./cmd/kuview-go/main.go` to start the backend server.
2.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server for the web client.

### Frontend Development

All routing logic is located in `src/App.tsx`, with page components in the `src/pages` directory. For a reference on resource visualization, see `src/pages/node.tsx`.

**Visualization Principles:**

1.  Each visualization should be encapsulated in a "Card" component within the `src/components/block` directory.
2.  All resource visualizations must be searchable. A common pattern is a two-part grid layout using the `Search` component from `src/components/block/search.tsx`. The `Node` page (`src/pages/node.tsx`) provides a good example.
3.  On a page, visualizations should be sorted by priority. Priority is defined as follows:
    - Potential for server failure (e.g., a pod in `CrashLoopBackOff` state).
    - Potential for performance bottlenecks (e.g., noisy neighbors on the same node).
    - Potential for security issues (e.g., a pod with excessive permissions).
4.  Use the `useKuview` hook to fetch Kubernetes resource data (e.g., `const nodes = useKuview("v1/Node");`).

### Backend Development

To support a new resource type, you need to modify `pkg/types/const.go` that defines the resource types. The client-side is designed to adapt to these backend changes automatically.
